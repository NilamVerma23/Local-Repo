**About**
This project is a simple demonstration of the steps required to push code from a local machine to a GitHub repository. It documents my learning journey as I explored the basics of Git and GitHub.

**What I Learned**
How to initialize a Git repository on a local machine.
How to stage and commit changes.
How to connect the local repo to a remote GitHub repository.
How to push commits from local to GitHub.

**Steps to Push Code to GitHub**
1. Initialize Git (if not already initialized): git init
2. Add files to the staging area: git add .
3. Commit the changes: git commit -m "Your commit message"
4. Add the remote repository: git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
5. Push to GitHub: git push -u origin main
